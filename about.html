            </div>
            <div class="text">When the trend of large firms acquiring smaller independent agencies began, [COMPANY
              NAME], a storied photo agency, was created in September 2003 to combat the convergence in the photography
              industry. At a time when everyone else seemed to be going big and corporate, [COMPANY NAME] went small and
              photographer-owned because it believed in the strength and energy of group effort. Being a revolutionary
              and innovative company, [COMPANY NAME] continues to swim against the tide.</div>
            <div class="text">
              [COMPANY NAME] has shifted its focus away from the area where its foundation was first laid. It is known
              for its unflinching photography that is enmeshed with the major contemporary topics. As often as they are
              found focused on migration or conflict, [COMPANY NAME] photographers and filmmakers can also be found
              focusing on race, gender, and identity.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        [COMPANY NAME] places a high importance on the ability of photographs to tell significant stories, amplifying
        local voices and tackling the difficult political, environmental, and social issues that families everywhere
        must grapple with. The [COMPANY NAME] group's members are driven by problems, and they are happy to put those
        problems above the cult of the photograph or the cult of the photographer.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Founded in September 2003, [COMPANY NAME] was given its name after the number of its founding members, all of
        whom were eminent photojournalists and documentarians who had been empowered and made possible by the ease with
        which their work could be distributed in what was at the time the new digital age of photography.
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The agency has developed into a diverse organization representing 30 photographers during the ensuing years,
        adding new economic opportunities in publishing and filmmaking to its high-level journalistic and documentary
        photography. The [COMPANY NAME] Foundation, a US-based media non-profit that targets systemic human rights
        concerns, and the [COMPANY NAME] Academy, which provides tuition-free journalism training to men and women from
        the majority world from its locations in Arles, France, and Sarajevo, Bosnia, are now closely partnered with
        [COMPANY NAME]. Since its founding, [COMPANY NAME] has gained a reputation as one of the world's leading
        photographer-owned photography and media organizations and has served as an inspiration to several imposters.
